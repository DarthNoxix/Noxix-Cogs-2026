## Usage

### For Users

Users can submit feedback using the `[p]feedback` command:

```bash
[p]feedback I'm having trouble logging into the system, it keeps saying my password is wrong
[p]feedback The new update is amazing! Everything works so much faster now
[p]feedback URGENT: The entire system is down and customers can't place orders!
```

The bot will:
1. Send the feedback to your n8n webhook
2. n8n processes it with AI categorization
3. n8n routes it to the appropriate department channel
4. Provide confirmation to the user

### For Administrators

#### Configuration Commands

```bash
# View current status and configuration
[p]knowledgebot status

# Enable/disable the system
[p]knowledgebot disable

# Test the n8n connection
[p]knowledgebot test This is a test message to verify n8n integration

# Manage departments
[p]knowledgebot department set <type> <channel> [name]
[p]knowledgebot department disable <type>
```

#### Department Types

- `success_story`: For positive feedback and success stories
- `urgent_issue`: For critical problems requiring immediate attention
- `ticket`: For general support requests

## Configuration Options

### Department Settings

Each department can be configured with:
- **Channel**: Where categorized feedback will be sent
- **Name**: Display name for the department
- **Enabled/Disabled**: Toggle department routing

### System Settings

- **Auto-categorization**: Automatically categorize and route feedback
- **Submission Channel**: Restrict feedback submission to specific channels
- **Log Channel**: Track all categorizations for review

## How It Works

1. **User submits feedback** using `[p]feedback <message>`
2. **Bot sends data to n8n** via webhook with user and context information
3. **n8n processes the feedback** using your existing OpenAI GPT-4 workflow
4. **n8n categorizes and routes** based on your workflow logic:
   - Success stories ‚Üí Customer Success
   - Urgent issues ‚Üí IT Department  
   - General requests ‚Üí Helpdesk
5. **n8n sends responses** to appropriate department channels via Discord webhooks
6. **Logging** records the feedback submission for review

## AI Categorization Logic

The AI uses the following criteria:

### Success Story
- Positive feedback and praise
- User appreciation and satisfaction
- Success stories and testimonials

### Urgent Issue
- Extreme dissatisfaction
- Critical problems with immediate impact
- System outages or major failures
- Security concerns

### Ticket (Default)
- General support requests
- Feature requests
- Minor issues
- Questions and inquiries

## Example Workflow

1. **User**: `[p]feedback I can't access my account, getting error 500`
2. **Bot**: Sends data to n8n webhook with user context
3. **n8n**: Processes with AI ‚Üí Categorizes as "urgent-issue" ‚Üí Routes to IT Department
4. **IT Channel**: Receives formatted message from n8n with user details and context
5. **User**: Gets confirmation that their feedback was sent for processing

## Troubleshooting
